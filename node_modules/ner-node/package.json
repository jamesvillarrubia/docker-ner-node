  "readme": "<h1>NER-Node</h2>\n<h5>Library to connect to Stanford NER local Server, send in the Raw Text and get back Entity JSON</h5>\n\n<h4><i>6X Performance Boost with <strong>Changed Syntax</strong> in versions 0.0.7 and further. Please do upgrade.</i></h4>\n\n<h4>Installation</h4>\n<ol>\n\t<li>npm install ner-node</li>\n\t<li>You can now try the test files to see the library working.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Usage</h4>\n<p>Here is an example of how you can call the library :-</p>\n\n````javascript\n// Importing the module\nvar socketNER = require(\"ner-node\")\n// Creating an instance\nvar NER = socketNER(port, classifierFileName, pathToNER)\n// Initiating Server and Client\nNER.init()\n// You can optionally define your own function to parse tagged text\nNER.parser = function (taggedText) {..... return entities}\n// Using the getEntities function of NER object anywhere to get the parsed entities\nvar entitiesJSON = NER.getEntities(rawText, requiredEntity)\n// Closes the server and client when done\nNER.close()\n\n````\n<p>\n\t<strong>Note:-</strong>\n\tThe npm package doesn't come with StanfordNER folder. You can download the latest from Stanford NER website OR get it from the git hub repository.\n</p>\n\n<h4>Updates</h4>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<h5>Versions upto 0.0.4</h5>\n\t\t<p>These versions uses node sockets to connect to NER server(A java command line command) but the sockets were very slow when it came to perfomance.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<h5>Versions 0.0.5 and 0.0.6</h5>\n\t\t<p>These version uses the NER Client(A java command line command) to ping NER server. I tested it out and found that it was way too fast and almost 6 times better with application, I was working on. This time I used Synchronize library to sync functions up But its disadvantage was that - It takes so many sync.fibar wrappers to keeps this working and that too wasn't possible in my case. Actually Synchronize library was useless and very frustrating.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<h5>Versions >=0.0.7</h5>\n\t\t<p>In this version, I switched back to deasync after doing some more standalone testing to convert async functions to sync one and able to create a fully sync API with node without any intentional sleeps. So there is a change in the sytax this time. This Version is even more efficient than previous versions.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Issues & Suggestions</h4>\n<p>If you find an issues using the Library OR if you have any suggestions to make it perform better, then you can write to us in the Issues Section.</p>\n\n<h4>Donate</h4>\n<p>If this repository helps you anyhow, please don't mind coming back and \n\t<a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=F3QQCWFPWHBYE\" target=\"_blank\">Buy Me Coffee</a>\nOR you can use \n\t<a href=\"https://gratipay.com/~xcelancer/\" target=\"_blank\">Gratipay</a>\nto show your appreciation and gratitude.\n</p>",
